  <p>&quot;The Ironwood Tree (Carpinus caroliniana), also referred to as Blue Beech, Musclewood, or American Hornbeam, resides in Eastern forests as a woodland understory tree. If one were walking along a trail, especially alongside a stream, you may encounter the quiet beauty of this tree. The first sign of recognition will be the smooth bark and the deeply fluted trunk. It will often be leaning or arched over in a graceful stature. Despite the tree's small size, the gnarled trunk gives it an ancient appearance. This trait is balanced by the refined, delicate foliage, which turns a rich red-orange in fall. The wood is extremely dense and strong, in ages long past, it was used in the making of handles for axes, hammers, and levers. One can admire the evolutionary path the tree has chosen - rather than compete with the canopy of Oaks, Beech, Tulips and Maples; the Ironwood tree lives in quiet harmony amongst them. It respects available resources, is not overly ambitious, resulting in a small, strong, distinct tree that displays quality in every characteristic.&quot;</p>
