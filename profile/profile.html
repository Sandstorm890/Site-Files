    <h1>Firm</h1>
  <p>David Berleth Landscape Architect, refers to a small firm designing landscapes for urban and rural residential properties in since 1995.  Conceptual Master Plans are drawn by hand, from a home office on Vashon Island, WA. During the construction phase of a project, the landscape architect selects materials and works closely with the landscape contractors on site to ensure quality and artistry of the project.</p>
    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>David was raised in the woodlands of northwestern New Jersey. The landscape has a subtle beauty, consisting of rolling hills, streams, hardwood forests and historic farms. 
<p>“In Childhood, I frequently explored the woods, followed small brooks and created trails. In later years, friends and I discovered an area with a secretive and mysterious character, we named it 'The Forest of Azure'. We would get lost in this intricate network of quiet, winding back roads that led through large historic properties with mature trees, old stone walls, gates, barns and greenhouses. I consider this my best education.”</p>   
<p>In college, (State University of New York (ESF), Syracuse, NY), David received a degree in Landscape Architecture. A semester was spent abroad in Austria traveling the countryside studying the interactions of trails adjacent to rivers, lakes and waterfalls. 
Upon graduation, spent 6 months traveling the country on back roads.  Arrived in Seattle in 1993.  
Met Chingfen in Taiwan, she was educated as a ceramic artist in Kyoto, now devoted to raising and home schooling our two children.  Her influence and opinions are of great value.  </p>
